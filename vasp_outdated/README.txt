Due to licensing issues, I can no longer test (and thus maintain) the VASP interface for aiida-tbextraction.
The files for this interface (in their last working state, i.e. pre-aiida 1.0) are kept here, as they might
be beneficial when / if someone wants to add back VASP compatibility.

Things might be partially migrated due to automatic search / replace.
